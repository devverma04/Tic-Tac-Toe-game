Tic Tac Toe Game
This project is a fully functional Tic Tac Toe (X and O) game developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
The game allows two players to take alternate turns, checks for winning combinations after each move, and handles draw situations. Once the game ends, players can easily reset and play again.

The main objective of this project was to practice DOM manipulation, event handling, game logic implementation, and basic UI design.

Features
Interactive 3x3 grid for gameplay

Real-time turn switching between players (X and O)

Win detection with winning combination highlight

Draw detection if all cells are filled with no winner

Game reset functionality

Simple, clean, and responsive UI

Technologies Used
HTML5 â€“ for the structure of the game board

CSS3 â€“ for styling and responsive layout

JavaScript â€“ for game logic, move tracking, and dynamic updates to the UI

How to Play
Player 1 is X and Player 2 is O.

Click on any empty cell to place your mark.

The first player to align three of their marks horizontally, vertically, or diagonally wins the game.

If all cells are filled without a winner, the game ends in a draw.
